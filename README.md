## Python Calculator

A calculator that keeps all your previous equations and results visible.

Run Calculator.py.

#Basics

Type your equation into the bottom input field. 
Do not use an equals (=) sign.
Press <Enter>.
Your equation will be appended to the left pane, and the result to the right pane.

#Syntax

This calculator makes use of the python interpreter, so all equations must be formatted as python would expect.

+ plus
- minus
* times
/ divide
() parentheses

These are the basic operators. You can use any more advanced operators that python understands.

#Variables

Each result is automatically assigned a variable name (shown in the middle pane). You can use these variables in any later equation.

Ex: 3 * X12 - X4

#Navigation

Use the <Up> and <Down> arrows to scroll through the previous equations, so you don't have to type the whole thing out again.

#Dice

There is special syntax for dice rolls: 
	XdY 
	where X is the number of dice 
	and Y is the number of sides on the dice.

Ex: 3d100 
This returns 3 rolls of a 100-sided dice.

If you are rolling dice, XdY must be the entire equation.
